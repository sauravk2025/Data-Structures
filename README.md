# 📚 Data Structures in C

This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate various core concepts of **Data Structures**, including:

- ✅ Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- 🌳 Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Traversals)
- 🔗 Graphs (BFS, DFS, Adjacency Matrix/List)
- 🔢 Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- 🔍 Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary)
- 🧮 Stacks and Queues (Array and Linked List Implementations)

These implementations are designed for learning, revision, and interview preparation.
